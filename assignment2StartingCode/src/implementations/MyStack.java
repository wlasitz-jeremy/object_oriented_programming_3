/**
 * An array-backed implementation of the {@link StackADT} interface,
 * for use in CPRG 304 at SAIT.
 * <p>
 * This class delegates all storage to an internal {@link MyArrayList},
 * treating the end of the list as the top of the stack. {@link #push(String)}
 * appends to the end; {@link #pop()} and {@link #peek()} access the last
 * element. A stack follows a <strong>Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)</strong>
 * ordering policy: the last element pushed is the first one returned.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Design Note – String-Specific Implementation:</strong><br>
 * This class is intentionally designed to store {@link String} elements only.
 * A fully reusable, type-safe design would use Java generics (e.g.,
 * {@code MyStack<E>}), allowing any object type to be stored in the stack.
 * Generic programming is outside the scope of CPRG 304 and has therefore
 * been omitted. All element fields, parameters, and return types are fixed
 * as {@link String} throughout this class and its implementations.
 * </p>
