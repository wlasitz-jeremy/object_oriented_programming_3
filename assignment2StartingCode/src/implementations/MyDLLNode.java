/**
 * A single node in a doubly linked list (DLL), used as the building block
 * for {@link MyDLL} in CPRG 304 at SAIT.
 * <p>
 * Each node stores a {@link String} element and maintains two directional
 * references: a predecessor ({@code pred}) pointing to the node immediately
 * before it in the chain, and a successor ({@code succ}) pointing to the
 * node immediately after it. A {@code null} predecessor indicates the node
 * is the head of the list; a {@code null} successor indicates it is the tail.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Design Note – String-Specific Implementation:</strong><br>
 * This class is intentionally designed to store {@link String} elements only.
 * A fully reusable, type-safe design would use Java generics (e.g.,
 * {@code DLLNode<E>}), allowing any object type to be stored in the node.
 * Generic programming is outside the scope of CPRG 304 and has therefore
 * been omitted. All element fields, parameters, and return types are fixed
 * as {@link String} throughout this class and its usages.
 * </p>
