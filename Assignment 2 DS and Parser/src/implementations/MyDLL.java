/**
 * A doubly linked list (DLL) implementation of the {@link ListADT} interface,
 * for use in CPRG 304 at SAIT.
 * <p>
 * This class stores {@link String} elements in a chain of {@link MyDLLNode}
 * objects, each of which holds a reference to both its predecessor ({@code pred})
 * and its successor ({@code succ}). The list maintains explicit {@code head}
 * and {@code tail} references for O(1) access to both ends of the chain.
 * Insertions and removals at arbitrary positions require O(n) traversal.
 * All index parameters are zero-based unless otherwise noted.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Design Note – String-Specific Implementation:</strong><br>
 * This class is intentionally designed to store {@link String} elements only.
 * A fully reusable, type-safe design would use Java generics (e.g.,
 * {@code MyDLL<E>}), allowing any object type to be stored in the list.
 * Generic programming is outside the scope of CPRG 304 and has therefore
 * been omitted. All element fields, parameters, and return types are fixed
 * as {@link String} throughout this class and its implementations.
 * </p>
